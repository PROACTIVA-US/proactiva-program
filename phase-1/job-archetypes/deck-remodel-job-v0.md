## Purpose
A repeatable skeleton for a deck or small remodel job end-to-end.

## Intake: minimum required fields
- Customer + site
- Project type (deck, flooring, framing, kitchen/bath partial, etc.)
- Photos/video (recommended)
- Measurements (rough dimensions)
- Material preferences (if any)
- Constraints: HOA, access, pets, timeline, occupant schedule
- Known hazards: rot, termites, asbestos/lead (if older home)

## Scope draft outline
1) Demolition / prep
2) Build / install tasks
3) Finish tasks
4) Cleanup and disposal
5) Assumptions + exclusions

## BOM-lite guidance
- Capture “must buy” items + long-lead items early
- Confirm substitutions with PM/Owner

## Escalation triggers
- hidden damage beyond intake (rot, water intrusion)
- structural issues
- permitting ambiguity
- scope expansion requests mid-job
