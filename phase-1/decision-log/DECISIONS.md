## D-001 — Technician-first UX priority (default)
- **Decision:** Optimize v0 flows for technician usability first; owner views are by-exception.
- **Rationale:** Adoption and time compression depend on field usability.
- **Reversibility:** Medium.

## D-002 — HVAC calculations assistive-only
- **Decision:** All HVAC calculations are assistive-only with explicit human confirmation; no code compliance claims.
- **Rationale:** Liability and trust boundary.
- **Reversibility:** Low.

## D-003 — PropertyManager posture
- **Decision:** Treat PropertyManager as reference + pattern mine; extract surgically as needed; no wholesale reuse.
- **Rationale:** Avoid inheriting misfit assumptions and coupling.
- **Reversibility:** Medium.
