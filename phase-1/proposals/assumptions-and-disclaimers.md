# Assumptions & Disclaimers

## Core principle (v0)
Proactiva provides **assisted** scope and calculation support. Final decisions and confirmations are made by qualified humans.

## Assumptions (examples — edit per job)
- Measurements provided are accurate to the best of our knowledge.
- Site conditions may vary once work begins (hidden damage, access constraints).
- Permitting/inspection requirements are handled per local jurisdiction and confirmed by the responsible party.

## HVAC-specific disclaimer (mandatory if HVAC work is involved)
- Any sizing, load, duct, or airflow recommendations are **assistive-only**.
- Recommendations must be reviewed and confirmed by a qualified technician and/or licensed professional as appropriate.
- Proactiva does **not** certify code compliance.

## Change conditions
If site conditions differ materially from intake:
- Work pauses at the relevant decision point
- A change order may be required
- PM/Owner approval is required to proceed beyond original scope
