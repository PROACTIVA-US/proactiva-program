## Purpose
A practical script for running a single job end-to-end using the Phase 1 artifacts.

## Steps
1) Choose archetype in `job-archetypes/`.
2) Complete intake using the relevant `forms/*.schema.json` as your checklist.
3) Draft scope using the archetype outline.
4) Produce proposal using `proposals/proposal-template.md` and attach `assumptions-and-disclaimers.md`.
5) Build an execution checklist by role, embedding escalation triggers.
6) Execute; pause and confirm on escalation triggers.
7) Closeout: capture final notes/photos, variances, and lessons learned. Update decisions if a reusable rule emerged.
