# Phase 1.2 Status — Pending Execution

Phase 1.2 defines the workflow, but the audit has not been executed in this repo context.

Execution will occur when:
- CC can access the candidate repo (PropertyManager), or
- the candidate repo is provided to an executor to perform the audit.

Recommended execution path:
- Use `pipelines/decision-audit/`
- Fill outputs under the invocation folder
- Submit outputs/DECISION_REPORT.md for Program Director action
