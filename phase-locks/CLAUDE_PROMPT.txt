CLAUDE EXECUTION PROMPT — PHASE 0–1 FORMAL LOCK

You are operating inside the `proactiva-program` repo.

Objective:
- Formally lock Phase 0–1 by verifying required artifacts and adding lock records.
- Do not change any canonical docs or phase folders other than adding `phase-locks/` and filling the lock report.

Steps:
1) Ensure repo is clean: `git status`.
2) Apply this bundle by copying `phase-locks/` into repo root.
3) Run:
   - `bash phase-locks/verify_phase_0_1_lock.sh`
   - If any missing items are reported, STOP and record details in `phase-locks/LOCK_REPORT.md`.
4) Complete `phase-locks/LOCK_REPORT.md` with YES/NO answers and evidence.
5) Ensure `phase-locks/PHASE_0_1_LOCK.md` is present and unchanged (it is the declaration).
6) Commit:
   - `git add phase-locks`
   - `git commit -m "Lock Phase 0–1 (formal verification + governance gating)"`
7) Respond with the commit hash and a short summary of any warnings.

Important:
- If checks fail, do not “fix” by modifying prior phase content. Record and stop.
