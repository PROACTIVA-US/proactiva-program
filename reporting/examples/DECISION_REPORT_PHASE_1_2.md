# Decision Report — Phase 1.2 (Example)

## Decision
Posture: **Extract patterns only**

## Authority
Within CEO authority. No Phase 0–1 lock changes required.

## Evidence
- Audit identifies reusable UI/auth patterns
- Data model and workflow assumptions conflict with Proactiva roles

## Risks
- Low if extraction-only boundary enforced

## Requested Action
Program Director approval to proceed with extraction in Phase 2.
