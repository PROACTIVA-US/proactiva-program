# Evidence Requirements — Decision Audit

Executor must include:
- Candidate inventory
- Hidden assumptions/worldview
- Coupling risks (data, auth, UI roles, workflows)
- Low-risk vs high-risk reuse candidates
- Blocking questions if evidence insufficient

Reviewer must verify:
- No lock-violating changes proposed
- No unsafe compliance/safety claims introduced
- Posture is justified by evidence
