## Proactiva Program Quick Reference

### What is this project?
Proactiva is a construction + HVAC operating program focused on running real jobs with reduced senior technician dependency.

### Key Constraints
- HVAC outputs are **assistive only** - human confirmation required
- No claims of code compliance
- Automation never replaces licensed authority

### Current Phase
Phase 1: Execute one HVAC job + one deck/remodel job end-to-end

### Key Files
- `phase-1/runbook/run-one-job.md` - How to execute a job
- `phase-1/workflows/canonical-flow.md` - The standard workflow
- `phase-1/decision-log/DECISIONS.md` - Record decisions here

### Workflow Tips
1. Read AGENTS.md before starting work
2. Follow the canonical workflow for job execution
3. Log all significant decisions in the decision-log
4. Commit frequently with meaningful messages
