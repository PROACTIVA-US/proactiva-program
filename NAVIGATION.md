# Proactiva Program Navigation

This file is the **human entry point** for the Proactiva repo.

## Start here
- **Program canon (Phase 0)**: see `program/CANON_INDEX.md`
- **Phases (execution pipeline)**: see `phases/00_PHASES_MAP.md`
- **Governance & enforcement**: see `program/GOVERNANCE_MAP.md`
- **Formal locks**: see `../phase-locks/` (or `phases/PHASE_LOCKS.md`)

## Principle
This navigation layer is additive only. It exists to keep the repo readable without breaking any locks.
